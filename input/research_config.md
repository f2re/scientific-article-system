# Research Configuration

**Title**: Model for reconstructing atmospheric vertical profile up to 0.1 hPa from aerological sounding data

**Goal**: Develop a method to extend vertical atmospheric profiles (temperature, humidity, wind) from the standard radiosonde ceiling (~30 km) up to 0.1 hPa (~65 km) using machine learning and reanalysis data.

**Key Requirements**:
- Input: Standard aerological sounding data (up to ~30 km).
- Output: Full vertical profile up to 0.1 hPa.
- Accuracy: RMSE comparable to ERA5 reanalysis in the stratosphere.
- Methods: Comparison of statistical extrapolation vs. Neural Networks.

**Target Journal**: Meteorology and Hydrology (or similar).
